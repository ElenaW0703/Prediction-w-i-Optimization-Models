### Prediction-with-Optimization-Models
*OptimizationModels.ipynb* \
Write a generic function which will be able to fit a Gaussian process regression model to each of provided data sets via maximum likelihood estimation. \
find the conditional predictive distribution of $y_p$ given $y$, $x$, $x_p$, and $\theta = (\sigma^2_n, \sigma^2_s, l)$. Given everything is a multivariate normal distribution, this conditional distribution is
$$ y_p | y, \theta \sim \text{MVN}(\mu^\star, \Sigma^\star)$$
